  <h2> About Rosaria </h2>
  <p style=color:black;background-color:white> Rosaria was born in a remote mountain village, but was taken from her home shortly after birth by the very same bandits who drenched it in blood. Raised by those crooks, she learned how to fight, sometimes thieving, other times doing odd jobs for the crew. </p>
